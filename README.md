# Delhi, the capital city of India, faces significant environmental challenges, particularly concerning air quality. The city's #Air #Quality #Index (#AQI) often reaches hazardous levels, impacting the health and well-being of its residents. This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of AQI in Delhi, examining the factors that contribute to air pollution and identifying patterns and trends over time.

#Objectives
#Identify #Key #Pollutants:

1.Determine the primary pollutants contributing to the AQI in Delhi.
2.Analyze the concentration levels of pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3.

#Assess #Seasonal #Variations:

1.Investigate how AQI levels vary with seasons.
2.Identify periods of the year with the highest and lowest pollution levels.

#Methodology
